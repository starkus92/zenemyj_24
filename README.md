# zenemyj_24


zenemyj_24 is a marth-based rapid prototyping machine focused on food. Its goal is to promote experiments and innovations in powder-based rapid-prototyping. The machine is ready to use.

Hardware

The zenemyj_24 consists of chassis, growing modules and its electronics. It has a simple design and can be built within a couple of hours. The machine is easy and affordable to build and modify. Building a zenemyj_24 machine costs about â‚¬1500-.

Software

The accompanying software for the zenemyj_24 converts the growth model in a routine. This file is then uploaded to the zenemyj_24 micro-controller board. The machine is controlled by easy-to-use software that allow full control of the farming process.The zenemyj_24 software has been based on open source tools like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

Materials

A whole new range of materials become available for experimenting with open-source rapid-prototyping. And when the growing process is fully supported, seaweed become available as food ready to eat.A generic cartridge is used for the deposition of the algae. The cartridge can be refilled with custom algaes using a syringe.
